# ðŸ§© Feature Template: LLMChat Feature Definition

This template is used to structure product features in a clear, outcome-driven format that aligns engineering, UX, and strategic goals.

Proceed in the following order unless the feature is already partially complete.

---

## 1. **User Story**

**Format:**  
_As a [user type], when I [trigger/context], I want to [action], so that [goal/value]._

**Purpose:**  
Capture the user's intent, context, and benefit in a single sentence.

âœ… Clarify if the task is vague, overly technical, or lacks a user type  
âœ… If appropriate, offer alternative phrasings  
ðŸ”¸ Ask: *What problem are they solving? Whatâ€™s the larger value?*

---

## 2. **Release Type**

Generally speaking, a feature will focus on one release type:
- **POC**: An internal team-only demo or write up that focuses on the core capabilities required for later releases. The goal is to verify the feasibility of the feature
- **Alpha**: A subset of capabilities on a system for interactive testing by the internal team, and (optionally) a small number of select users. An Alpha does not need to scale beyond the internal team size.
- **Beta**: An almost fully functional version of the feature, accessible to users. Beta comes in 3 flavors: (1) "Usability Beta" - Invite only on a non-production system in order to perform usability testing (limited time access, moderated feedback session) prior to release, (2) "Closed Beta" - Invite only on the production system for a subset of users, followed up with feedback gathering sessions, (c) "Open Beta" - Accessible to all users to gather a broader set of feedback. With Beta, bugs and usability issues are expected, and is a good way to vet the 'final feature' prior to GA in order to fix any bugs etc.
- **GA**: Full functionality released to all users with no constraints

**Guidance:**  
âœ… Include rationale for stage chosen
âœ… Multiple stages OK, especially for net-new features  
âœ… A Beta release will often be paired with GA release
ðŸ”¸ Prompt if unclear: *Is this intended as an Alpha or a Usability Beta?*

---

## 3. **Business Requirements**

**WHAT this feature must achieve and WHY.**

âœ… Focus on outcomes and business logic  
âœ… Avoid UI or implementation details  
âœ… Prompt for whatâ€™s IN vs. OUT of scope for this release
âœ… The last part of the requirements must be the WHY of the feature. Who does the feature benefit, and what value or impact will this feature provide

ðŸ”¸ Ask: *What happens if we donâ€™t ship this? What does success look like?*
ðŸ”¸ Ask: *How does this feature benefit the target users?*

---

## 4. **Assumptions & Dependencies**

List key technical, business, or behavioral assumptions. Include:

- External system dependencies  
- Required design readiness  
- Feature gating conditions

âœ… Identify cross-team or architecture links  

ðŸ”¸ Ask: *What must be true for this feature to succeed?*
ðŸ”¸ Ask: *What must be true for work on this feature to start?*
ðŸ”¸ Ask: *What risks blocking this feature if proven false?*

---

## 5. **Foundational Research**

Choose one or more:
- No research needed  
- Discovery / Journey Mapping  
- Competitive UX Pattern Research  
- Technology/Architecture Scan

âœ… Required for novel capabilities, new user types, or domain-specific UX
ðŸ”¸ Ask: *Is this something weâ€™ve seen or done before?*

---

## 6. **UX Design Needs**

Select all that apply:
- No design needed  
- Low-fi wireframe  
- Mid-fi design  
- High-fi design  
- Interactive prototype

**Guidance by release stage:**
- **POC** â†’ Should include UX design involvement to produce a low-fi wireframe as an output
- **Alpha/Beta/GA** â†’ Needs a mid-fi or better, depending on the extent of the expected changes. A Minor UX change only needs a mid-fi design, but larger changes will need a high-fi design, and more complex features would benefit from an interactive prototype


âœ… UX designs are required before Alpha, Beta or GA releases
âœ… UX designs are required before implementation work can begin
 
ðŸ”¸ Ask: *What is the expected impact on the current UX?*
ðŸ”¸ Ask: *What is the simplest design artifact needed to test this?*

---

## 7. **Logging Plan & Measuring Impact**

Split into:
- **Data to Capture** (user/system actions, metadata)
- **Metrics to Derive** (adoption, success rate, abandonment)

âœ… Include whatâ€™s logged now vs. what needs to be added
âœ… Focus on what actions and supporting metadata need to be captured
ðŸ”¸ Ask: *What does success look like in data?*

---

## 8. **System Diagram Needs**

Choose one:
- Minor/no impact  
- System diagram update  
- Tech Wiki update

âœ… Diagram update only required if new tools, APIs, or agents are added  
âœ… Tech wiki update required if process flow or data structures are changing

ðŸ”¸ Ask: *Would this affect dev onboarding or architecture understanding?*

---

## 9. **Acceptance Criteria**

Split into 4 lists:
- **User Facing** â€” _As a user, I canâ€¦_  
- **Back End** â€” _The product shouldâ€¦_  
- **Logging** â€” _The metadata mustâ€¦_  
- **Regression** â€” _The product should stillâ€¦_

âœ… Should be testable, clear, and tied to requirements  
ðŸ”¸ Ask: *What would QA or PM use to verify this?*

---

## 10. **Open Questions / Unresolved Items**

Optional section.

Use this to capture:
- Decisions still pending  
- External clarifications needed  
- Items deferred to a follow-on release

âœ… Often useful for Alpha/Beta handoffs  
ðŸ”¸ Ask: *Whatâ€™s still fuzzy, risky, or open-ended?*

---

**Usage Tips:**
- Each section can be revised iteratively  
- When vague inputs are given, treat them as starting points  
- Always validate feature logic against product stage, user need, and technical reality
